# OpenSCAD Clip for HSW
This is a library to make one-way clip-in inserts for use with the Honeycomb Storage Wall (HSW) system.

The clip has a built-in spring and the shape makes it much easier to push in directionally.

It is inspired by [KYZ's](https://www.printables.com/@KYZ_446301) V2 clips and gives OpenSCAD users a base library item to use clips in HSW designs.

Relies on the [BOSL2 OpenSCAD library](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2)

Parameters within source allow generation of:
* hsw_clip: just the clip
* hsw_clip_with_hex_base: the clip with an HSW-compatible hexagonal base
* hsw_clip_with_rect_base: the clip with an HSW-compatible rectangular base
* hsw_clipconnector: a simple little connector to hold two neighboring pieces of HSW together
